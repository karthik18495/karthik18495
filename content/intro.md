subtitle: "Physics × Data Science"

I'm a data scientist and optimization researcher building **scalable AI** and **HPC solutions** for complex scientific problems. My work combines Bayesian optimization, **distributed ML** pipelines, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to drive real-time decision-making in large-scale physics experiments and AI evaluation platforms.

Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Data Science at William & Mary, I design adaptive experimentation systems and **LLM-powered applications** that turn high-dimensional, noisy data into actionable insight—bridging scientific rigor with industry-grade AI systems.
