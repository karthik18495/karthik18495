subtitle: "Physics × Data Science"

I am a data physicist and optimization researcher, currently exploring the fascinating crossroads of **AI**, **high-performance computing**, and **experimental physics**. My work spans Bayesian optimization and adaptive experimentation for particle detector design, and developing grounded large language models to help scientists make sense of complex knowledge landscapes.

As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Data Science at the College of William and Mary, I build tools for experiments like GlueX and the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider — where the art of turning noisy, high-dimensional data into insight is both a science and a bit of an adventure.
